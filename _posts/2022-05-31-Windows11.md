# Windows 11
Useful stuff to change on fresh install of Windows 11

## Change right click to classic menu

**1.** Open Regedit by hitting the Windows key and typing **regedit**. Hit Enter to launch it.

**2.** Navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\CLSID

**3.** Right-click > New > Key, and paste in this name: **{86ca1aa0-34aa-4e8b-a509-50c905bae2a2}**

**4.**With the new key you just created highlighted, again right-click > New > Key, and paste in this name: **InprocServer32**

**5.** Double-click the **(Default)** registry entry and then hit Enter without typing anything to set its value to blank. Before making this change, you'll see under the Data column that it says (value not set), but once you hit Enter it'll show nothing.

**6.** Close Registry Editor. To see your new (classic) context menu, either restart your computer or open Task Manager, scroll down to the Windows Explorer process, and right-click > End task. Then File > Run new task and type **explorer.exe** to restart the Windows explorer process. And there you go: context menus changed!
