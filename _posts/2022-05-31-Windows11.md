## Useful stuff to change on fresh install of Windows 11

### **Change right click to classic menu**

**1.** Open Regedit by hitting the Windows key and typing **regedit**. Hit Enter to launch it.

**2.** Navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\CLSID

**3.** Right-click > New > Key, and paste in this name: **{86ca1aa0-34aa-4e8b-a509-50c905bae2a2}**

**4.**With the new key you just created highlighted, again right-click > New > Key, and paste in this name: **InprocServer32**

**5.** Double-click the **(Default)** registry entry and then hit Enter without typing anything to set its value to blank. Before making this change, you'll see under the Data column that it says (value not set), but once you hit Enter it'll show nothing.

**6.** Close Registry Editor. To see your new (classic) context menu, either restart your computer or open Task Manager, scroll down to the Windows Explorer process, and right-click > End task. Then File > Run new task and type **explorer.exe** to restart the Windows explorer process. And there you go: context menus changed!

### **VLC first time startup slow**

**Solution A** VLCwin7User on the [VideoLan forums](https://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?t=144201) came up a solution that I will paraphrase and add to:

1. Bring up an administrative command prompt in the vlc.exe directory. This would typically be `C:\Program Files (x86)\VideoLAN\VLC` for 32-bit, or `C:\Program Files\VideoLan\VLC` for 64-bit.(To bring up an administrative prompt in this directory, open the Start menu and type `cmd`. Right click on `Command Prompt` and select `Run as administrator`. Then type `cd`, space, and then the VLC directory, and press enter.)
2. Issue `vlc-cache-gen .\plugins` enter... which generates \plugins\plugins.dat

This brought launch time down to less than a second on my machine.

**Solution B** This is the solution I had originally tried, but it only reduced the launch time by about 25%. I'm putting it here for completeness. I did not notice this making much difference after using Solution A from above.

1. Open VLC preferences via the menu or by pressing +.
    
    CTRL
    
    P
    
2. Select `show settings` > `All` from the bottom left corner
3. In the `Advanced` section, uncheck "Scan for new plugins"

### **Search images lesser then specific resolution**

Open Windows Explorer and search for:

```windows
width:<800 height:<600
```

*  *  *  *  *

### **Add shortcut to Network Connections**

Create a shortcut on the Desktop and paste in:

**rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL ncpa.cpl**

Afterwards you can pin it to Start, open location of the Start icon and pin to taskbar

### **Add a network device to the Windows Defender exclusion list**

2. Enter:
```windows

```
